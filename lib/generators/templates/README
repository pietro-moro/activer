Activerse installed.
Remember to use the initializer file to create your
desired credentials structure. You may run

  rails g activerse:fill

to fill out your credentials file. Addition made into the
initializer will reflect on the credentials file upon
reissuing this command.


You may want to regenerate your master key with

  rake activerse:regenkeys

or generate fresh credentials with

  EDITOR="vim" rails credentials:edit


Remember that either your config/credentials.yml.enc
and your config/master.key files *must not* be under
source control.
