===========================================================

Activerse installed.

Ensure you point your root correctly. For example:

  # good
  activerse_then_root to: 'home#index'

  # bad
  activerse_then_root to: ''
  root to: 'home#index'


You may want to regenerate your master key with

  rake activerse:regenkeys

or generate fresh credentials with

  EDITOR="vim" rails credentials:edit


Remember that either your config/credentials.yml.enc
and your config/master.key files *must not* be under
source control.
